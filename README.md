# Image-Video-processing-scripts-for-analyzing-and-manipulating-media-files
A Python tool for processing images and videos with a GUI made with Tkinter and powered by OpenCV. Converts files to grayscale and applies a threshold to create binary images/videos. Ideal for developers interested in image and video processing, provides a foundation for building more complex tools. Well-commented and organized code.
Image/Video Processing Tool

This is a Python tool for processing images and videos with a graphical user interface (GUI). It was created using Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV for the image and video processing. The tool can be used to convert an image or video to grayscale and apply a threshold to it, resulting in a binary image or video where each pixel is either black or white based on its intensity.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Tkinter (standard library)

OpenCV 4.x

How to Use

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the script using python main.py.

Use the file dialog to select an image or video file.

The processed image or video will be displayed in a window created by OpenCV.

Features

Conversion of image or video to grayscale.

Application of threshold to binary image or video.

Easy-to-use GUI created with Tkinter.

Processing powered by OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library.
